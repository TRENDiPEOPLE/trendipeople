This is the fashion sharing and discovering MVP project for week 15 of Founders & Coders January cohort. We are aiming to build a platform where users can upload pictures of themselves in their favourite fashion style and be rated by other users, in the process maybe starting a new fashion trend. Users will be able to search the site by what is trending and view images of other users that have been highly rated. There will also be the possibility of filtering results by geolocation and seeing what fashion trends are developing in specific places in real time.

The emphasis is on everyday people and not promoting the unrealistic, idealised version of what beauty looks like that is shown in today's media.



To run this project:


```git clone```  
```cd trendipeople```  
```npm install```  
```gulp```
